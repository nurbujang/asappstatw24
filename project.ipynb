    "\n",
    "In this project, the PlantGrowth R data set was analysed. A histogram and box plot were generated for data visualisation. The different types of t-tests and assumptions were discussed. The ctrl, trt1, and trt2 variances are equal. There is no evidence to suggest that data is not normally distributed in trt1, trt2, and ctrl. There is evidence to conclude that trt1 and trt2 means are not equal from the two-tailed Independent Two-Sample t-test. There is also evidence to conclude that there is a difference in means between ctrl, trt1, and trt2 in One-way ANOVA. Following the significant result, Tukey's HSD test was performed as a post hoc test and concluded that trt1 and trt2 have significantly different means."

    "#### 2.3.3.2 Sample size \n",
    "\n",
    "The second assumption is that the sample size for both groups is of considerable size. A Student's t-test is appropriate to use when the sample size is around 30, while a larger sample size should use a z-test [(King and Eckersley, 2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780081029398000141?via%3Dihub). The sample size is important because the data has to be normally distributed, which is difficult to achieve with a small sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another concern is that poor data representation by small sample sizes tends to produce less precise estimates. The standard error is also increased, which makes it harder to detect a true difference between groups (Type I and II errors), eventually leading to a reduced power of test (rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true). Standard error decreases as sample size increases [(Linkedin, 2024)](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-impact-does-sample-size-have-standard-error-mean-t0qpe). However, according to [Bobbitt (2021)](https://www.statology.org/minimum-sample-size-for-t-test/), there is no minimum sample size for a t-test. [Skaik (2015)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4744321/) stated that for a sample size that is less than 15, the one-sample t-test is inappropriate if the data is skewed and contains significant outliers. A study conducted by [de Winter (2013)](https://openpublishing.library.umass.edu/pare/article/1434/galley/1385/view/) on Type I error from t-test on 5 to 15 samples found that there is no issue in using t-test on a sample size as small as n=2.\n",

    "#### 2.3.3.3 Homogeneity of Variance with Levene's Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Another assumption for t-test is that variances are equal across both groups. Homogeneity of variance is important because the standard error in the denominator of the t-statistic formula relies on an assumption of equal variances. In pooled variance, when sample sizes are equal, each group contributes equally to the pooled variance, preventing one group's variance from disproportionately affecting the estimate. The group with the larger sample size will create an imbalance by dominating the pooled variance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the variances are not equal, when pooled, the standard error, ${s / \\sqrt{n}}$ will either overestimate or underestimate the true standard error. This will result in incorrect t-statistics and p-values, which in turn may lead to Type I error (rejecting a true null hypothesis) and Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) [(Wikipedia, 2021c)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors). This will decrease the power of test (the probability of detecting a true effect or correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true), thus making the test unreliable [(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019f)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Levene's test was performed to assess homoscedasticity [(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019d)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levene%27s_test). Levene's test is less sensitive to normality, as opposed to Bartlett's test, which is better if there is strong evidence that the data is normally distributed [(NIST, 2019)](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35a.htm). Levene's test was performed using scipy.stats and imported from the library [(The SciPy community, n.d.)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.levene.html). "

    "### 2.6 Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are only two groups involved, the t-test and F-test are similar, with $F = t^2$ [(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019e)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_analysis_of_variance). However, for more than two groups, ANOVA offers a simple, one-step test to compare all means compared to pairwise tests. It is quicker, more efficient, and prevents confusion and mistakes because all the means are compared simultaneously instead of analysing different pair combinations from multiple groups. This is especially difficult when the number of groups, $n$, is high, making calculations more unmanageable, interpretations difficult, and increasing the chance of making mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because each test carries its own risk of Type I error (false positive by incorrectly rejecting true null) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\">(Wikipedia, 2021b)</a>, if each test has a 5% chance of Type I error, multiple pairwise t-tests will cumulatively inflate this risk as $n$ increases. For example, if $n$ is 10, the number of t-tests to perform is 45, and the likelihood of making Type I error if each test carries a 5% chance of Type I error is at least twice. In contrast, the Type I error for a single ANOVA test will remain at a 5% chance, regardless of the number of groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing multiple hypotheses for more than two groups, the chance of Type I error increases, thus requiring the need for Bonferroni correction <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\">Wikipedia Contributors (2019d)</a>. Because Bonferroni correction tests each hypothesis at $\\alpha$/number of hypothesis, the smaller corrected $\\alpha$ level requires stronger evidence to reach significance, thus increasing the risk of a Type II error <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\">Wikipedia Contributors (2019d)</a>. Type II error or false negative is failing to reject a false null hypothesis <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\">(Wikipedia, 2021b)</a>, which consequently lowers the probability of detecting a real effect for each test compared to ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is better for multiple groups because it divides variance into Within-Group Variance and Between-Group Variance. The F-statistic for ANOVA  is the ratio of variance between treatments to variance within treatments (or error variance) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019a)</a>. According to <a href=\"https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-analysis-of-variance-anova-and-the-f-test\">(Minitab, 2016)</a>, the denominator Mean Square Within (MSW), which is the pooled estimate of within-group variance, is like a background noise which values should be low to be able to differentiate between signal (differences between group means) and noise (random variability within groups). The pooled variance also provides a more precise variance estimation because of the larger data pool from all combined groups and a reduced influence of outliers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooled_variance\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2024)</a>. This higher variance precision increases the statistical power of the test to detect true differences and reduces the chance of Type II errors (failing to detect a true effect) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooled_variance\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2024)</a>. On the other hand, the pairwise comparison of highly variable individual variances, when repeated across multiple pairs in multiple t-tests, will result in low statistical power.\n",

Conversely, a t-test is better because it could identify whether a mean is significantly greater than or less than the other. However, one could always proceed with a post hoc test to identify where the differences lie such as Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) test and Tukey's HSD test <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/beta?topic=anova-one-way-post-hoc-tests\">(IBM Corporation, n.d.)</a>.

Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test is a single-step method that compares all possible pairwise comparisons between group means <a href=\"https://arc.lib.montana.edu/book/statistics-with-r-textbook/item/59\">(Greenwood and Banner, n.d.)</a>.\n",

According to [Wikipedia Contributors (2019m)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test), Tukey's HSD test is essentially a t-test, except that it corrects for family-wise error rate.
