Continuous data is particularly suited for t-test because the test relies on accuracy in means calculations. The rationale for using continuous data for a t-test is it often approximates a normal distribution, which meets t-test's normality requirement [(Curtin University Library, n.d.)](https://uniskills.library.curtin.edu.au/numeracy/statistics/normal-distribution/) and provides a valid mean and standard deviation calculation in each group.

    "### 2.6 Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than two groups, ANOVA offers a simple, one-step test to compare all means compared to pairwise tests. It is quicker, more efficient, and prevents confusion because all the means are compared simultaneously instead of analysing different pair combinations from multiple groups. This is especially difficult when the number of groups is high, making calculations more unmanageable, making interpretations difficult, and increasing the chance of making mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each test carries its own risk of Type I error (false positive by incorrectly rejecting true null) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\">(Wikipedia, 2021b)</a> if each test has a 5% chance of Type I error, multiple pairwise t-tests will cumulatively inflate this risk. In contrast, the Type I error for a single ANOVA test will remain at a 5% chance, regardless of the number of groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)\">Wikipedia Contributors (2019d)</a>, the power of test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. When testing multiple hypotheses for more than two groups, the chance of Type I error (false positive) increases, thus requiring the need for Bonferroni correction <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\">Wikipedia Contributors (2019d)</a>. Because Bonferroni correction tests each hypothesis at alpha/number of hypothesis, the smaller corrected alpha level requires stronger evidence to reach significance, thus increasing the risk of a Type II error <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\">Wikipedia Contributors (2019d)</a>. Type II error or false negative is failing to reject a false null hypothesis <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\">(Wikipedia, 2021b)</a>, which consequently lowers the probability of detecting a real effect for each test compared to ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA is better for multiple groups because it divides variance into Within-Group Variance and Between-Group Variance. The F-statistic for ANOVA  is the ratio of variance between treatments to variance within treatments (or error variance) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019a)</a>. According to <a href=\"https://blog.minitab.com/en/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-analysis-of-variance-anova-and-the-f-test\">(Minitab, 2016)</a>, the denominator Mean Square Within (MSW), which is the pooled estimate of within-group variance, is like a background noise whose values should be low to be able to differentiate between signal (differences between group means) and noise (random variability within groups). The pooled variance also provides a more precise variance estimation because of the larger data pool from all combined groups and a reduced influence of outliers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooled_variance\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2024)</a>. This higher variance precision increases the statistical power of the test to detect true differences and reduces the chance of Type II errors (failing to detect a true effect) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooled_variance\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2024)</a>. On the other hand, the pairwise comparison of highly variable individual variances, when repeated across multiple pairs in multiple t-tests, will result in low statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that because ANOVA's overall hypothesis testing does not specify which group has a significantly different mean, while with a t-test, we can identify whether a mean is significantly greater than or less than the other. However, one can always proceed with a post hoc test to identify where the differences lie such as Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) test and Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spss-statistics/beta?topic=anova-one-way-post-hoc-tests\">(IBM Corporation, n.d.)</a>. Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) is a stepwise, pairwise comparison method where means are ordered from highest to lowest and compared starting from the closest ranks and then moving further <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newman%E2%80%93Keuls_method\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2020)</a>. Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test is a single-step method that compares all possible pairs of group means Means are ordered from highest to lowest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test\">(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019h)</a>.
