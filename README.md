**by Nur Bujang (G00426044@atu.ie)**

## Overview
This repository contains the tasks and project for module Applied Statistics (Instructor: Dr Ian McLoughlin). 

## Features
### tasks.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains 4 tasks, which are Permutations and Combinations, numpy's Normal Distribution, t-Test Calculation and ANOVA. Each of these tasks contains Plan, Methods and Implementation, Conclusion and References sections.

### project.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook contains the body of work for project "Analysis of Plantgrowth Data Set". This README.md contains the full list of references used in this project. The full list of contents are listed below: 

* PROJECT TITLE: Analysis of Plantgrowth Data Set

* Project Description

* Abstract

* 1.0 Plan

* 2.0 Methods and Implementation

    * 2.1 Download and save dataset

    * 2.2 Describe the data set

    * 2.3 Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are

        * 2.3.1 T-test

        * 2.3.2 How does a t-test work?

        * 2.3.3 Assumptions

            * 2.3.3.1 Continuous Data

                * 2.3.3.1.1 Histogram

                * 2.3.3.1.2 Box Plot

            * 2.3.3.2 Sample size

            * 2.3.3.3 Independence and Random Sampling

            * 2.3.3.4 Homogeneity of Variance with Levene's Test

            * 2.3.3.5 Test for Normality with Shapiro-Wilk Test

                * 2.3.3.5.1 Q-Q Plot

                * 2.3.3.5.2 Shapiro-Wilk Test

    * 2.4 Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups trt1 and trt2

        * 2.4.1 Independent Two-Sample T-test

    * 2.5 Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups ctrl, trt1, and trt2

        * 2.5.1 One-way ANOVA

    * 2.6 Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups

* 3.0 Conclusion

* 4.0 References
