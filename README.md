## PROJECT LIST OF CONTENTS

* PROJECT TITLE: Analysis of PlantGrowth Data Set

* Project Description

* Abstract

* 1.0 Plan

* 2.0 Methods and Implementation

    * 2.1 Download and save dataset

    * 2.2 Describe the data set

    * 2.3 Describe what a t-test is, how it works, and what the assumptions are

        * 2.3.1 T-test

        * 2.3.2 How does a t-test work?

        * 2.3.3 Assumptions

            * 2.3.3.1 Test for Normality with Shapiro-Wilk Test

                * 2.3.3.1.1 QQplot

                * 2.3.3.1.2 Shapiro-Wilk Test

            * 2.3.3.2 Test for Equality (Homogeneity) of Variances

            * 2.3.3.3 Random Sampling

            * 2.3.3.4 Test for Independence


    * 2.4 Perform a t-test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the two treatment groups trt1 and trt2

        * 2.4.1 Independent Two-Sample T-test

    * 2.5 Perform ANOVA to determine whether there is a significant difference between the three treatment groups ctrl, trt1, and trt2

        * 2.5.1 One-way ANOVA

    * 2.6 Explain why it is more appropriate to apply ANOVA rather than several t-tests when analyzing more than two groups

* 3.0 Conclusion

* 4.0 References
